# IRL Methods

High-quality reference implementations of various algorithms for Inverse
Reinforcement Learning.

(c) 2018 Aaron Snoswell

## Requirements

Tested and developed with Python 3.5.5 on Windows. Requirements are handled
by [setup.py](/setup.py), but currently include

 * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 * [Cvxopt](http://cvxopt.org/)
 * [OpenAI gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)

## Installation

Clone this repository, then let `setup.py` do it's thing. I suggest you use a
python environment manager like [Conda](https://conda.io/).

```
git clone https://github.com/aaronsnoswell/irl_methods
cd irl_methods
python setup.py install
```

A PIP package will be forthcoming when the package is more mature.

## Usage

Documentation coming. For now check the docstrings in the individual modules.
