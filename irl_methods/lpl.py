    """Linear Programming IRL for large state spaces by Ng and Russell, 2000

    Given a sampling transition function T(s, a_i) -> s' encoding a stationary
    deterministic policy and a set of basis functions phi(s) over the state
    space, finds a weight vector alpha for which the given policy is optimal
    with respect to R(s) = alpha Â· phi(s).

    See https://thinkingwires.com/posts/2018-02-13-irl-tutorial-1.html> for a
    good overview of this method.
    
    Args:
        sf (function): A 'state factory' function that takes no arguments and
            returns an i.i.d. sample from the MDP state space
        M (int): The number of sub-samples to draw from the state space when
            estimating the expert's reward function (|S_0|)
        k (int): The number of actions (|A|)
        T (function): A sampling transition function T(s, a_i) -> s' encoding
            a stationary deterministic policy. The structure of T must be that
            the 0th action T(:, 0) corresponds to a sample from the expert
            policy, and T(:, i), i!=0 corresponds to a sample from the ith
            non-expert action at each state, for some arbitrary but consistent
            ordering of actions.
        phi (list of functions): A vector of basis functions phi_i(s) that
            take a state and give a float.

        N (int): Number of transition samples to use when computing
            expectations. For deterministic MDPs, this can be left as 1.
        p (float): Penalty function coefficient. Ng and Russell find p=2 is
            robust. Must be >= 1.
        verbose (bool): Print progress information
    
    Returns:
        A tuple containing;
            - A numpy array of alpha coefficients for the basis functions.
            - A result object from the LP optimiser
